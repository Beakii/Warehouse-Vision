# Warehouse Vision

![Warehouse Vision Screenshot](https://imgur.com/FAbQs26)

**Warehouse Vision** is an interactive warehouse management tool designed to help visualize, plan, and manage racking spaces within a warehouse.  
It features a customizable "warehouse designer" where users can create and adjust warehouse layouts on a resizable grid — each grid square representing one pallet's worth of racking space.
